# Project Name: Weather App with Python and Kivy

**Description:**
The Weather App is a user-friendly application developed to display real-time weather information and forecasts for various cities worldwide. The project was created using Python and the Kivy framework to ensure cross-platform compatibility.

**Key Features:**
- Display current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, and weather description.
- Ability to view the weather forecast for the next three days.
- Interactive user interface with easy-to-use controls such as text input fields and buttons.
- Use of graphics and animations to enhance the user experience.
- Integration of various APIs, including OpenWeather for weather data and Api-Ninjas for location time information.

**Technologies:**
- Python: Used for backend logic and data processing.
- Kivy: An open-source framework for developing cross-platform applications with Python.
- JSON: Used for processing data from external sources such as the OpenWeather API.
- API Integration: Integration of OpenWeather API for weather data and Api-Ninjas API for location time information.

**Special Features:**
- Separation of design and logic using the Kivy Language (KV) to define the user interface.
- Efficient data processing through the use of JSON formats for exchanging information between the application and external APIs.
- Optimization of user experience through intuitive user interface and appealing design.

**Future Developments:**
- Implementation of additional features such as user accounts, favorite locations, and notifications for weather changes.
- Improvement of weather forecast accuracy through integration of additional weather APIs and prediction enhancement algorithms.
- Extension of platform support to mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

**Usage Guide:**
1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website and follow the installation instructions.
2. Install the Kivy framework using the Python Package Installer (pip). Open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:
   ```
   pip install kivy
   ```
3. Clone or download the Weather App project repository from GitHub.
4. Navigate to the project directory and run the main.py file using Python:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
5. The Weather App should launch, displaying the main window with current weather information. Enter the name of a city in the text input field and click the "Search" button to view the weather forecast for that city.
