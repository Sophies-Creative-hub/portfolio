# PomodoroApp

A simple Pomodoro timer application built using Python and Tkinter.

## About

This Pomodoro timer application helps users manage their time effectively by utilizing the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, which involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This technique aims to improve productivity and focus by encouraging regular breaks and timeboxing tasks.

## Features

- Set customizable work and break intervals.
- Start, pause, resume, and reset the timer.
- Visual and audio cues to indicate when intervals end.
- Track and display the number of completed Pomodoro cycles.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Usage

To use the Pomodoro timer application, simply run the Python script. You can adjust the work and break intervals by clicking on the respective buttons and inputting your desired durations. Once you're ready, click the "Start" button to begin the timer. Visual and audio cues will alert you when each interval ends, and you can manage the timer using the control buttons provided.
